Study japanese using JMDict and Kanjidic

[Ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe/) is a great tool for learning Japanese. But we are in 2023, we don't like to open websites. So why don't we bring it to our comfortable `CMD+Space` ?

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run build`
- Open Raycast
- Search for Ichikasuto

## Publish to Raycast?

The scraper is not working perfectly, yet. Also, there are some guidelines to publish an extension to Raycast, which I don't want to follow right now. But feel free to adequate these things.
